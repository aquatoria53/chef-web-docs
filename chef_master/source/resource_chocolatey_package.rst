.. tag resource_package_chocolatey

Use the **chocolatey_package** resource to manage packages using Chocolatey on the Microsoft Windows platform.

.. end_tag

.. warning::
             The **chocolatey_package** resource must be specified as ``chocolatey_package`` and cannot be shortened to ``package`` in a recipe.



**New in Chef Client 12.7.**

Syntax
=====================================================
A **chocolatey_package** resource manages packages using Chocolatey on the Microsoft Windows platform. The simplest use of the **chocolatey_package** resource is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   chocolatey_package 'package_name'

which will install the named package using all of the default options and the default action (``:install``).

The full syntax for all of the properties that are available to the **chocolatey_package** resource is:

.. code-block:: ruby

  chocolatey_package 'name' do
    options           String
    package_name      String, Array
    returns           Integer, Array # default value: [0]
    source            String
    timeout           String, Integer
    version           String, Array
    action            Symbol # defaults to :install if not specified
  end

where:

* ``chocolatey_package`` is the resource.
* ``name`` is the name given to the resource block.
* ``action`` identifies which steps Chef Infra Client will take to bring the node into the desired state.
* ``options``, ``package_name``, ``returns``, ``source``, ``timeout``, and ``version`` are the properties available to this resource.

Actions
=====================================================

The chocolatey_package resource has the following actions:

``:install``
   Default. Install a package. If a version is specified, install the specified version of the package.

``:nothing``
   .. tag resources_common_actions_nothing

   This resource block does not act unless notified by another resource to take action. Once notified, this resource block either runs immediately or is queued up to run at the end of a Chef Infra Client run.

   .. end_tag

``:purge``
   Purge a package. This action typically removes the configuration files as well as the package.

``:reconfig``
   Reconfigure a package. This action requires a response file.

``:remove``
   Remove a package.

``:uninstall``
   Uninstall a package.

   Deprecated as of Chef 13.7

``:upgrade``
   Install a package and/or ensure that a package is the latest version.

Properties
=====================================================

The chocolatey_package resource has the following properties:

``options``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   One (or more) additional options that are passed to the command.

``package_name``
   **Ruby Type:** String, Array

   The name of the package. Default value: the name of the resource block.

``returns``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer, Array | **Default Value:** ``[0]``

   The exit code(s) returned a chocolatey package that indicate success.

   The syntax for ``returns`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      returns [0, 1605, 1614, 1641]

``source``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Optional. The path to a package in the local file system or a reachable UNC path. Ensure that the path specified is to the **folder** containing the chocolatey package(s), not to the package itself.

``timeout``
   **Ruby Type:** String, Integer

   The amount of time (in seconds) to wait before timing out.

``version``
   **Ruby Type:** String, Array

   The version of a package to be installed or upgraded.

Common Resource Functionality
=====================================================

Chef resources include common properties, notifications, and resource guards.

Common Properties
-----------------------------------------------------

.. tag resources_common_properties

The following properties are common to every resource:

``ignore_failure``
  **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``false``

  Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason.

``retries``
  **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``0``

  The number of attempts to catch exceptions and retry the resource.

``retry_delay``
  **Ruby Type:** Integer | **Default Value:** ``2``

  The retry delay (in seconds).

``sensitive``
  **Ruby Type:** true, false | **Default Value:** ``false``

  Ensure that sensitive resource data is not logged by Chef Infra Client.

.. end_tag

Notifications
-----------------------------------------------------

``notifies``
  **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

  .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

  A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notify more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

  .. end_tag

.. tag resources_common_notification_timers

A timer specifies the point during a Chef Infra Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

``:before``
   Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

``:delayed``
   Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of a Chef Infra Client run.

``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
   Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

.. end_tag

.. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

.. code-block:: ruby

  notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

.. end_tag

``subscribes``
  **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

.. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

Note that ``subscribes`` does not apply the specified action to the resource that it listens to - for example:

.. code-block:: ruby

 file '/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt' do
   mode '0600'
   owner 'root'
 end

 service 'nginx' do
   subscribes :reload, 'file[/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt]', :immediately
 end

In this case the ``subscribes`` property reloads the ``nginx`` service whenever its certificate file, located under ``/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt``, is updated. ``subscribes`` does not make any changes to the certificate file itself, it merely listens for a change to the file, and executes the ``:reload`` action for its resource (in this example ``nginx``) when a change is detected.

.. end_tag

.. tag resources_common_notification_timers

A timer specifies the point during a Chef Infra Client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

``:before``
   Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

``:delayed``
   Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the end of a Chef Infra Client run.

``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
   Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

.. end_tag

.. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax

The syntax for ``subscribes`` is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   subscribes :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

.. end_tag

Guards
-----------------------------------------------------

.. tag resources_common_guards

A guard property can be used to evaluate the state of a node during the execution phase of a Chef Infra Client run. Based on the results of this evaluation, a guard property is then used to tell Chef Infra Client if it should continue executing a resource. A guard property accepts either a string value or a Ruby block value:

* A string is executed as a shell command. If the command returns ``0``, the guard is applied. If the command returns any other value, then the guard property is not applied. String guards in a **powershell_script** run Windows PowerShell commands and may return ``true`` in addition to ``0``.
* A block is executed as Ruby code that must return either ``true`` or ``false``. If the block returns ``true``, the guard property is applied. If the block returns ``false``, the guard property is not applied.

A guard property is useful for ensuring that a resource is idempotent by allowing that resource to test for the desired state as it is being executed, and then if the desired state is present, for Chef Infra Client to do nothing.

.. end_tag

**Properties**

.. tag resources_common_guards_properties

The following properties can be used to define a guard that is evaluated during the execution phase of a Chef Infra Client run:

``not_if``
  Prevent a resource from executing when the condition returns ``true``.

``only_if``
  Allow a resource to execute only if the condition returns ``true``.

.. end_tag

Examples
=====================================================
The following examples demonstrate various approaches for using resources in recipes:

**Install a package**

.. tag resource_chocolatey_package_install

.. To install a package:

.. code-block:: ruby

   chocolatey_package 'name of package' do
     action :install
   end

**Install a package with options**

This example uses Chocolatey's ``--checksum`` option:

.. code-block:: ruby

   chocolatey_package 'name of package' do
     options '--checksum 1234567890'
     action :install
   end

.. end_tag
